# PHP

## Quick Overview
- Server-side language created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994
- Popular software built with PHP: WordPress, Drupal, Joomla
- Understanding PHP could be beneficial for exploring topics in cybersecurity


## Note
I used PHP to develop ALL the projects I created before 2019. Now that several years have passed and I'm almost free from the confinement of the formal education system, it's time to revisit my old friend.


## Running PHP Code Locally
There are at least 2 options:
- **Using XAMPP**: includes Apache, MariaDB, PHP and Perl to set up a local development environment
- **Using the terminal**: basic scripts or command-line applications can be executed by installing PHP CLI. On Debian-based Linux distributions, try: `sudo apt install php8.3-cli`
